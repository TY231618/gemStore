Angular mess around

if running node use npm install -g http-server. After installation cd into your project folder and run http-server -o. -o is to open browser to the page

need local server as ng-include or custom directives returning a template.html will not work due to CORS restrictions

custom directives are good as it makes the html more expressive and can show what the application is doing
